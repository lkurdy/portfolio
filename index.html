							<h2>PullTastic</a> - 2024</h2>
							<p></p>
							<p><strong>PullTastic</strong> is my best work, my goal is to finish the game and release it on steam.</p>
							<p>It is an online multiplayer platformer that requires teamwork to clear the levels.</p>
							<p>This is how much progress I made in just 3 weeks:</p>

							<p>I began learning Godot Engine when I started developping PullTastic, I began learning and trying my best to draw PixelArt using Aseprite at the same time. Everything you see is made by me, using these amazing tools.</p>
							<p>This video is the current version of PullTastic 3 more weeks later, it's 4 minutes long so feel free to skip ahead if needed.</p>

							<p>Everything is created by me, except the sound which is CC0 and modified by me. In this version the mechanics are good for a full game but the level design is enough for just a demo.</p>

							<p><strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong> always fascinated me, when I finally built my first PC in 2023 I immediately started learning to use it. This little project is just a demonstration of what I learnt on my own.</p>

							<p>Just like the original Bomberman, you place a bomb, it explodes in a plus shape and destroys the crates that it hits. If it hits a player, he dies, if it hits another bomb it detonates in a chain reaction. There are stat upgrades that spawn randomly when a crate is destroyed.</p>
							<p>I made the character's movement in C++, the rest in Blueprints. I also made the explosion projectile and the upgrades with the Niagara system.</p>

							<p><strong>Ft_transcendence</strong>, our final 42 project. It's a dynamic single-page app featuring a pong game, chat functionality, online game mode, and an array of features. While video demonstrations may be limited, I invite you to explore <a href="https://github.com/rben-tkh/ft_transcendence/tree/master">the repository</a> or dive directly into some of <a href="https://github.com/rben-tkh/ft_transcendence/blob/master/back/src/gateway/game.ts">my contributions.</a></p>

							<p>Three of us worked on the project, none of us had any experience in web development beforehand. I handled the backend game server, implementing game mechanics, and handling sockets using Typescript with NestJS and React. Working as a team was a challenge, but also a great skill that we developed.</p>

							<p>This project put everything we've learnt into practice. We are very proud of the journey and the result.</p>

						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/lkurdy/so_long">So_Long</a></strong> is the first mini-game I made during my institution's curriculum. It was a challenge to make a graphical game using C and a third-party library (MinilibX).</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="html5up-paradigm-shift/images/pacman.png"  /></span>
							<p>The visuals were inspired by one of my favourite retro-games, Pac-Man. I learnt from this project the concept of rendering.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="html5up-paradigm-shift/images/pacman2.png"  /></span>
							<p>No monsters in this one, just some dots to eat.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/lkurdy/cub3d">Cub3D</a></strong> was also a 42 project made using the library MinilibX in C.</p>
							<iframe class="video" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QhBmm40nwMA?si=63rVq4AUaCSSCfA9&autoplay=1&rel=0&mute=1&loop=1" title="Cub3D" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p>In a team of two, we recreated the graphical environment of Wolfenstein 3D, developed by id Software. I learned and implemented the raycasting technique, while my partner worked on analysing the game's map, including textures, the player's starting position, and orientation.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="html5up-paradigm-shift/images/cub3d_3.png"/></span>
							<p>Raycasting allowed me to turn a 2D map, like the one above, into a 3D perspective. We can move around the map smoothly and rotate the camera to view the walls properly from different angles.</p>
