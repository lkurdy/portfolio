							<h2>ft_transcendence - 2023/2024</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Ft_transcendence</strong> was the final 42 project. It's a single-page app created by beginner web developers, but we learnt a lot along the way. The project requires a Pong game with online and offline modes, social system, leaderboards, ranks and many more.</p>

							<p>We were 4 working on this project, I handled the backend server and the sockets in the backend and frontend using Typescript with NestJS/React. Working as a team was the biggest challenge of this project, but also a great skill that we developed.</p>

							<p>This project felt more professional than the ones before it, everyone was competent and doing their part. Most importantly everyone was working together till the end goal, which we are very proud of.</p>

							<h2><a href="https://github.com/lkurdy/Bomberman_UE5">Bomberman</a> - 2024</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong> always fascinated me, when I finally built my first PC in 2023 I immediately started learning to use it. This little project is just a demonstration of what I learnt on my own.</p>
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8LyOQkF1sXk?si=pWFPmVveMIvwCWWr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p>Just like the original Bomberman, you place a bomb, it explodes in a plus shape and destroys the crates that it hits. If it hits a player, he dies, if it hits another bomb it detonates in a chain reaction. There are stat upgrades that spawn randomly when a crate is destroyed.</p>
							<p>I made the character's movement in C++, the rest in Blueprints. I also made the explosion projectile and the upgrades with the Niagara system.</p>

							<h2><a href="https://github.com/lkurdy/so_long">So_Long</a> - 2022</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/lkurdy/so_long">So_Long</a></strong> is the first mini-game I made during my institution's curriculum. It was a challenge to make a graphical game using C and a third-party library (MinilibX).</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="html5up-paradigm-shift/images/pacman.png"  /></span>
							<p>The visuals were inspired by one of my favourite retro-games, Pac-Man. I learnt from this project the concept of rendering.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="html5up-paradigm-shift/images/pacman2.png"  /></span>
							<p>No monsters in this one, just some dots to eat.</p>

							<h2><a href="https://github.com/lkurdy/cub3d">Cub3D</a> - 2022</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/lkurdy/cub3d">Cub3D</a></strong> was also a 42 project made using the same library (MinilibX) in C, but it pushed it to a whole new level.</p>
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QhBmm40nwMA?si=63rVq4AUaCSSCfA9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p>As you can see, this one's an FPS game, unlike So_long which is a top-down. This change in the camera position added a difficulty regarding the rendering which was solved using the raycasting technique.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="html5up-paradigm-shift/images/cub3d_3.png"/></span>
							<p>Raycasting allowed me to turn a 2D map, like the one above, into a 3D perspective. We can move around the map smoothly and rotate the camera to view the walls properly from different angles.</p>
